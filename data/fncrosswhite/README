These are the data files for the matrix elements used by Michael Reid in his emp code.
They were retrieved from his webpage, http://www2.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/~mfr24/emp/, in June of 2023.
In parsing these with Mathematica a few non-consequential typos were found and fixed. These typos simply had to do with how the different columns were split apart. There were about three of these typos, which might simple be inconveniences for parsing the data with the ad-hoc heuristic implemented in the notebook "Table Comparisons.nb"

Here's the original readme from M. Reid:

This directory contains corrections to the mk and pk operators
Jean Margerie (jean.margerie@ismra.fr) brought these to our attention
Xueyyan Chen (xchen70@anl.gov) modified the files.
