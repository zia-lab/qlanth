It was shown that the knowledge of one out of three parameters (B, C, f) allows to estimate the remaining two. Systematic behavior of the trivalent 3d ions in some cubic crystals (Y3Al5O12 and GaAs) was also considered; different degree of the nephelauxetic effect for the B and C parameters in Y3Al5O12 was uncovered. Using the literature data on the crystal ﬁeld parameters for trivalent 3d ions in Y3Al5O12 and GaAs, the values of the crystal ﬁeld parameters for Gd3Ga5O12, AlAs and InAs were estimated.},

	abstract = {Yttrium aluminum garnet (Y3Al5O12, YAG) is one of the most important optical materials with many existing and potential future applications in laser, illumination, and scintillation. X-rays, J-rays, and UV light can induce ionization and significant changes in the valency of impurities and defects in YAG single crystals which may lead to the formation of color centers. In fact, the use of YAG crystals in laser and scintillation devices involves significant formation of color centers and requires full understanding for their characteristics and effects on the material properties. In this work, the formation and characteristics of color centers in undoped and rare-earth doped YAG single crystals was investigated mainly through optical absorption spectroscopy. An increase in the absorption over a broad range of wavelengths was observed in the as-grown sample after UV irradiation. F-centers and iron impurities in the as-grown undoped crystals were found to be responsible for the formation of color centers. However, air- or oxygen-anneal seems to be effective in suppressing most color centers in the crystals.},

Part 2 is devoted to the computation of the energy distances between multiplets, and comparison of these distances with experiment in some typical examples. There is no treatment of the separations between the various terms of a multiplet, since that has been done elsewhere, but only between one multiplet and another. It is found that Hund's rule, that terms of large L and 8 values lie lowest, has no general significance; the present theory leads to the same results as the rule when it is obeyed experimentally, but many cases which were exceptions to that rule are in agreement with the theory. The method of calculation of multiplet distances is described in sufficient detail, with the necessary tables of coefficients, etc., so that further checks with experiment could easily be made.},

	abstract = {Coherence rephasing is an essential step in quantum storage protocols that use echo-based strategies. We present a thorough analysis on how two adiabatic rapid passages (ARPs) are able to rephase atomic coherences in an inhomogeneously broadened ensemble. We consider both optical and spin coherences, rephased by optical or radio-frequency (rf) ARPs, respectively. We show how a rephasing sequence consisting of two ARPs in a double-echo scheme is equivalent to the identity operator (any state can be recovered), as long as certain conditions are fulﬁlled. Our mathematical treatment of the ARPs leads to a very simple geometrical interpretation within the Bloch sphere that permits a visual comprehension of the rephasing process. We also identify the conditions that ensure the rephasing, ﬁnding that the phase of the optical or rf ARP ﬁelds plays a key role in the ability of the sequence to preserve the phase of the superposition state. This settles a difference between optical and rf ARPs, since ﬁeld phase control is not readily guaranteed in the former case. We also provide a quantitative comparison between ⇡ -pulse and ARP rephasing efﬁciencies, showing the superiority of the latter. We experimentally verify the conclusions of our analysis through rf ARP rephasing sequences performed on the rare-earth ion-doped crystal Tm3+:YAG, of interest in quantum memories.},

At low temperatures vibrational satellites corresponding to spontaneous phonon emission are observed only on the low energy side of the nophonon R lines which are located at 6863.2 and 6872.6 A. At higher temperatures, vibronic emission appears also on the high energy side, corresponding to phonon absorption. With increasing temperature. the vibronic bands become more intense relative to the R lines. the peaks broaden, and a fluorescence continuum extends from 6500 to 8000 A. The fluorescence lifetime ofthe 'E level which is 8.5 ms at 77 K decreases rapidly above 150 K to 1.6ms at 300 K. The enhancement of the transition probability of the vibronic emission can account for the major temperature dependence of the fluorescence lifetime without requiring the contribution of purely - - nonradiative transitions. For this case a calculation of the purely radiative lifetimes can be made. The values are found to be T,,d ( R I ) 0.07 s and t,,d (R,) 0.09 s.},

The occurrence of a set of common ionic intermediates for azulene and naphthalene is qualitatively demonstrated by the similarity of their mass spectra and by the metastable transitions. Comparison of the difference of the appearance potentials for the same secondary ions in both compounds with the difference in the heats of formation for these molecules in the vapor state indicated that for each of several fragment ions appearing in the spectra of naphthalene and azulene, the lowest ionized state through which the two isomers pass has energies equal within the limits of the experimental uncertainty. These common ionic intermediates appear to be states of the C1oHs+ ions.},

	abstract = {We report on the growth, structural and optical properties of YAlO3 single crystals grown by optical floating zone technique. Powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic studies confirm the phase purity of the crystals. Raman analysis reveals that the intensity and line-width of Raman bands increase significantly with beta irra­ diation indicating the formation of structural defects in YAlO3 lattice. The optical properties are studied through UV–visible absorption, and photoluminescence emission and excitation spectroscopies under pre- and post- beta irradiation. The optical studies indicate the presence of Sm and Cr impurities by exhibiting characteristic emission lines in the orange red region. Further, a systematic study on the thermoluminescence (TL) charac­ teristics of the crystal is also carried out at different doses of beta irradiation. The crystals exhibit a prominent TL glow peak at 239 �C for less than 5 Gy doses while a weak second glow peak evolves at higher doses. Also, the crystals show a nearly linear dose response in the studied range from 0.1 to 10 Gy. The glow curve analysis reveals that the TL emission obeys the first order kinetics model. Based on the optical studies, the plausible mechanism for the TL glow curve is discussed in terms of the intrinsic defects and impurities that are present in the crystal.},

	title = {Multi-electron coefficients of fractional parentage for the p, d, and f shells},
	abstract = {The definition and group-theoretical properties of fractional parentage coefficients are reviewed from a more general, multi-electron perspective. The natural gener­ alization of the ideas of the second quantization is discussed, and a formal proof is given for the relation between fractional parentage coefficients and reduced matrix elements of generalized multi-electron creation operators. Recursion relations be­ tween fractional parentage coefficients of different electron-number are derived, and some of the general symmetries of a full set of CFPs are explored. The factoriza­ tion of the fractional parentage coefficients in terms of isoscalars of the associated group-reduction chain is discussed in the general multi-electron case. An exam­ ple application of multi-electron CFPs to the specific problem of determining the explicit form of a change-of-basis transformation is presented, and the alternative quark-basis representation of the wavefunctions of f electrons is discussed.
The complete minimal subsets of multi-electron coefficients of fractional parentage for p, d, and f electrons are computed and tabulated via a computer automation of the recursion relations and the symmetries of the CFPs. Through further use of au­ tomation the obtained fractional parentage coefficients are reduced with respect to their spin-quasispin factors. The general problem of computer automation of exact- form calculations in atomic spectroscopy is presented, and various subalgorithms are discussed. The software package with which the fractional parentage coefficients were computed and factorized is described in terms of its design specifics.},

	abstract = {Andrew and Meissner have shown that a first-approximation formula of the theory of Bacher and Goudsmit leads to better results than a second-approximation formula in several spectra with s and p electrons. The first-approximation formulas are not uniquely defined, and the theory as a whole does not account for the effects of strong configuration-interaction, even when this interaction can be estimated with second-order perturbation theory. In O iii experimental data are adequate to demonstrate roughly that errors from these two sources cancel, and thus explain the good agreement.In spectra with s and d electrons, where configuration interaction is less a factor, two first-approximation formulas are shown to yield better results than higher approximations if Racah's modification of the theory of Bacher and Goudsmit is used. The superiority is most marked in spectra of the normal atoms, while in spectra of ions the first three approximations are more or less equivalent and all are very accurate. The Slater theory as recently expanded to include polarization effects (i.e., the linear theory) implies the possibility of getting the best significant agreement in a first approximation, but this is not expected in Racah's modification. It is probably obtained because the parameters increase twice as much with change of a d to an s electron as they do with addition of a d electron and a unit increase in the atomic number. It is not likely that this sort of relationship would be valid in entirely different types of configurations. In the latter it is expected that a second-approximation formula would give best results, but a suitable first approximation could be found by trial and error.It is shown that the normal spectra follow the same pattern as the spectra of ions if configuration interaction or an irregular variation of the polarization parameters is assumed to cause the d2 configuration to be 3155 K too high above the ds configuration in Ca i, and 6542 K too high in Sr i. The equivalence of the linear theory and the theory of Bacher and Goudsmit theory is therefore, strongly indicated, insofar as effects of third- or higher order perturbations seem not to be observable, even in the normal spectra where they are expected to be strongest.Third- and higher-order approximations may be required when the Bacher and Goudsmit theory is applied in its original formulation, if the variation of parameters of the linear theory is complicated with respect to change in the degree of ionization. In all our formulas for spectra with s and d electrons, the original theory improves, the higher the order of the approximation. However, it is noted that the agreement obtained with the third-approximation formulas is not as good as expected on the basis of the linear theory if a simple power series variation of the parameters is assumed to apply.},

The use of these recoupling techniques avoids the usual extensive calculation of the sums of products of the matrix elements of tensors of the types Vκk and Uk. The derived expressions involve the sums of products of coefficients of fractional parentage and n − j symbols, and as such, are amenable to machine computation.},

Up to 51 energy levels have been determined for this ion, and labelled by irreducible representations, E or A, assuming local symmetry. These energy levels have been used to estimate the crystal field ( parameters) acting on the ion in this host crystal. As the optical spectra present additional structure owing to the presence of four centres, laser site selective spectroscopy has been used to determine the Stark sublevels of the ground state for each particular centre. Thus, the slight variations of the parameters from one centre to another have been investigated and interpreted in terms of different -off centre positions for ions.},
