Deviations between theoretical and experimental values of the sph-rblt coupling constant for rare earth ions are used to estimate the adjustments fiat should be made to ( l / r s {\textgreater} when calculating the magnetic hyperhe mteracbon. The effective values of this quantity thus obtained are found to be m excellent agreement with experiment.
