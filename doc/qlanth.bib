	title = {Multi-electron coefficients of fractional parentage for the p, d, and f shells},
	abstract = {The definition and group-theoretical properties of fractional parentage coefficients are reviewed from a more general, multi-electron perspective. The natural gener­ alization of the ideas of the second quantization is discussed, and a formal proof is given for the relation between fractional parentage coefficients and reduced matrix elements of generalized multi-electron creation operators. Recursion relations be­ tween fractional parentage coefficients of different electron-number are derived, and some of the general symmetries of a full set of CFPs are explored. The factoriza­ tion of the fractional parentage coefficients in terms of isoscalars of the associated group-reduction chain is discussed in the general multi-electron case. An exam­ ple application of multi-electron CFPs to the specific problem of determining the explicit form of a change-of-basis transformation is presented, and the alternative quark-basis representation of the wavefunctions of f electrons is discussed.
The complete minimal subsets of multi-electron coefficients of fractional parentage for p, d, and f electrons are computed and tabulated via a computer automation of the recursion relations and the symmetries of the CFPs. Through further use of au­ tomation the obtained fractional parentage coefficients are reduced with respect to their spin-quasispin factors. The general problem of computer automation of exact- form calculations in atomic spectroscopy is presented, and various subalgorithms are discussed. The software package with which the fractional parentage coefficients were computed and factorized is described in terms of its design specifics.},
